## Semnahesht Project

Semnahesht (Tehran City Transportation Management System) is a project designed to calculate the shortest distance, time, and cost between two points in Tehran, based on the city map. This project is developed to efficiently implement and utilize various data structures such as arrays, graphs, stacks, and queues. Semnahesht is a graphical project implemented using QML, with the logic layer developed in C++.

## How the Program Works

The program operates by allowing users to select a starting point, destination, and departure time. It then calculates and displays the optimal route based on the shortest distance, lowest cost, and minimum time. The program also suggests the appropriate transportation mode, indicates when to switch lanes or vehicles, and provides the estimated arrival time. Users can switch between these three criteria (distance, cost, time) to find the best route according to their preference.

## Algorithms Used

The core algorithm of the program is a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. To enhance speed and reduce the program's time complexity, a priority queue is employed.

## How To Run

For run program you need to install Qt framework first and then open project and run it !
